## üìù Contact Form Setup (Netlify)

The contact form functionality relies on Netlify's built-in form handling feature.

* The form element in `index.html` uses the attributes `name="contact"` and `data-netlify="true"`.
* To enable the form, deploy the site to Netlify. Netlify will automatically detect and process submissions sent to the endpoint defined in the JavaScript.
